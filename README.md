# 🎬 Video Editor Portfolio

A modern and immersive portfolio website showcasing my work as a **Video Editor**, focused on high-quality **horizontal videos (16:9)** and **short-form content**.

This project was designed to reflect my editing style, creative direction, and technical precision — combining clean visuals, smooth interactions, and curated content to present my work professionally to an international audience.

## ✨ About the Project

This website serves as my **main video editing portfolio**, highlighting:

- Long-form video edits (YouTube, highlights, AMVs)
- Short-form content (Shorts, Reels-style edits)
- Creative pacing, transitions, color grading, and sound design
- A strong focus on **gaming content (Roblox)** while remaining versatile for other niches

The layout and animations are inspired by modern streaming platforms (Netflix-style carousels), aiming for an engaging and premium browsing experience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Although this is a creative portfolio, the site is built with a strong technical foundation:

- **React / Next.js**
- **TypeScript**

The tech is intentionally invisible — the content always comes first.
